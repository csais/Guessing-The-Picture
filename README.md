# Guessing-The-Picture
Java project - guessing the picture.
Screen is split into rectangular cells that cover an image. The user can enter guesses into the box. 
If correct, screen reveals the image (an animal). Else, user keeps on guessing and cells continue
to disappear until the entire image is shown.
